# BigMart Sales Prediction Project

**Introduction**

Shopping malls and Big Marts collect extensive data on individual item
sales to forecast future demand and optimize inventory management. This
project aims to build a machine learning solution capable of predicting
the sales of different stores within Big Mart based on the provided
dataset.

**Project Steps**

**1. Data Preparation**

-   **Data Collection**: Gathered dataset containing information on item
    sales in Big Mart stores.

-   **Data Exploration**: Explored the dataset to understand its
    structure and characteristics.

-   **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and adjusted
    data types.

**2. Data Manipulation**

-   **Data Blending**: Combined and integrated data from various sources
    for a comprehensive dataset.

-   **Feature Generation**: Created new features based on existing data
    for improved model performance.

**3. Model Training**

-   **Algorithm Used**: Utilized Linear Regression and
    RandomForestRegressor for sales prediction.

-   **Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding**: Processed categorical
    variables for model training.

-   **Data Splitting**: Segmented the dataset into training and testing
    sets.

**4. Model Optimization**

-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conducted GridSearchCV to optimize Random
    Forest hyperparameters.

-   **Ensemble Models**: Explored ensemble methods for enhanced
    predictive performance.

**5. Model Evaluation**

    R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error.

-   **Cross-Validation**: Employed RepeatedStratifiedKFold for robust
    model evaluation.

**7. Visualization**

-   **Visualization Libraries**: Used matplotlib, seaborn, and klib for
    visualizing dataset characteristics.

**8. Model Selection**

-   **Bag of Models**: Explored the concept of using a diverse set of
    models for improved predictions.

-   **Model Factory**: Considered creating a factory for generating and
    testing various models.

**9. Data Normalization and Feature Selection**

-   **Normalization**: Ensured numerical features were on a similar
    scale for effective model training.

-   **Feature Selection**: Explored techniques to select the most
    relevant features for model training.
